    <string name="dogQuote">"The only selfless friend that a man can have in this selfish world,
        the one who never leaves you, the only one who never shows ingratitude or betrayal, is your dog" </string>

    <string name="firstDogTraining">"This is the first training exercise you should try to do.\n\n

1 - Take a snack and show it to your dog.\n\n
2 - When your dog shows interest in the snack (and it sure will!), He will follow you with his nose, trying to reach you.\n\n
3 - Keep the snack above your dog's head, so that he looks upwards, and move it until it is behind the nose so that he has to move his head back. The only way for your dog to reach the snack is to sit.\n\n
4 - The moment he does, click and give him the snack with lots of praise.\n\n
5 - After a few attempts, your dog will know what it has to do to deserve your click and snack and your response to "Sit down" will be much faster.\n\n
6 - When he fully understands what is expected, say "Sit down" and he will sit down because he associated the word with the action.\n\n
7 - Now that you have taught him the “Sit down” command, with practice, you'll be able to ask him to sit down without having to put him in position using the snack."

    <string name="firstDogTrainingTitle2">How to train you dog to give you its paw</string>
    <string name="dogQuote2">"“A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than he loves himself.” – Josh Billings </string>
    <string name="dog2">dog</string>

    <string name="firstDogTraining2">"How to start.\n\n

1 - Stock up on your dog’s favourite treat and make sure you have some nearby when you start teaching your dog to shake paw.\n\n
2 - Choose an area in your house or garden to teach your dog this new trick and for consistency, use the same area each time you train your dog. \n\n
3 - Select a simple verbal command that you will use each time you ask your dog to give you their paw.\n\n
4 - If your dog can’t already sit on command, teaching them how to do this should be fairly simple. It’s much easier to teach them to give paw if they’re already in the sit position.\n\n
5 - Make sure you have a treat in one hand to entice them into action. When your dog is sitting down, gently tickle the back of one of their front legs. Your pooch will react by moving their leg towards you. Reward them with a treat when they do this.\n\n
6 - Once they understand what you want them to do, introduce your chosen verbal command and start using this while holding your own hand out. When your dog understands and responds to the command, reward them with another treat.\n\n
7 - You should keep your training sessions short and sweet, but practice daily for around ten minutes until your dog can give you its paw on command."

    <string name="firstCatTrainingTitle">How to train your cat to sit</string>
    <string name="catQuote">“A happy arrangement: many people prefer cats to other people, and many cats prefer people to other cats.” – Mason Cooley </string>
    <string name="cat">cat</string>
    <string name="foodCat">food</string>
    <string name="firstCatTraining">"How to Start\n\n

1 - Emphasize the oral order you use to teach your cat what he wants him to do (such as "sit"), speaking clearly and confidently and reinforcing with encouraging praise (for example, "sit, good, sit").\n\n
2 - Use food-based rewards as positive reinforcement during your kittens training. After all, wouldn't you be more willing to work hard if you knew that you would receive a delicious reward?\n\n
3 - Use a "clicker" or a soft bell when giving your cat a snack to help him associate that sound with a reward. He will learn to perform a task when he hears that sound in the future.\n\n
4 - Train your kitten or cat before meals, because a food reward will not be as appealing on a full stomach. At the same time, don't let your cat go hungry to try to learn; a hungry cat will quickly lose patience!\n\n
5 - Try to eliminate any background noise, such as distraction from a television or radio, to help your cat stay focused.\n\n
6 - When he fully understands what is expected, say "Sit" and he will sit down because he associated the word with the action.\n\n
7 - Be consistent with the training sessions, with the same trainer (whether you are a professional or a professional), the same orders, signals and rewards."

    <string name="catQuote2">“I had been told that the training procedure with cats was difficult. It’s not. Mine had me trained in two days.” </string>
    <string name="cat2">cat</string>
    <string name="firstCatTraining2">"How to Start\n\n

1 - Try to place yourself somewhere calm and without distractions to start the training session.\n\n
2 - If they already know how to sit, give that order first. If not, you can always give them a little touch by pushing the bottom of the spine down to sit on the floor.\n\n
3 - Now give the order " hello "," paw ", " give me the paw "or the one you want to use, at the same time you offer your hand to your cat with your palm up.\n\n
4 - Wait for your pet to put their paw on top of it and when they do, give them a snack as a reward.\n\n
5 - If they do not put your paw on your palm, pick it up for a few moments and put it in your hand. Then give your cat a treat so they will begin to associate that gesture with a prize.\n\n
6 - Repeat this operation a few times, no more than 10 minutes a day.\n\n
7 - At first your cat will not understand what you want them to do but after a few training sessions they will realise this gesture leads to a treat. "

    <!-- Tips Fragment -->
    <string name="tips_title">Basic care / duties for you to be like your pet!</string>
    <string name="tips_1">1. Protection - It is the duty of the owner to protect his animal from the sun and rain, in addition to preventing pets from escaping or going out alone on the street. Thus, we avoid fights, being run over, poisoning and unwanted offspring.</string>
    <string name="tips_2">2. Feeding - Always offer good quality food, respecting the characteristics of each animal and age group (puppy, adult and elderly). And always provide clean, fresh water.</string>
    <string name="tips_3">"3. Neutering - Neutering is always advisable when you don't want a puppy. With this, we avoid overpopulation, abandonment, uterine diseases, neoplasms (cancer), prostate diseases, aggressiveness and territory marking."</string>
    <string name="tips_4">4. Walks and games - Animals also need attention and affection. Therefore, it is necessary to walk dogs regularly and play with toys. In this way, we stimulate both the physical and the psychological, helping to prevent diseases caused by stress and obesity.</string>
    <string name="tips_5">5. Vaccination - Dogs and cats have a vaccination schedule according to their species and individual characteristics. Vaccination is usually annual and can only be performed by a veterinarian. Vaccines prevent serious diseases that can lead the animal to death, as well as diseases that can be transmitted to humans (zoonoses).</string>
    <string name="tips_6">6. Parasite control - Owners should still watch out for flea and tick infestations, which can transmit serious diseases to animals and humans.</string>
    <string name="tips_7">7. Wormers - Like vaccines, wormers are very important, as intestinal parasites (worms) can compromise the health of animals, leading to weight loss, hair loss, anemia and zoonoses.</string>
    <string name="tips_8">8. Oral hygiene - Dogs and cats also need to brush their teeth, but with specific veterinary products. Periodontal diseases, in addition to causing unpleasant bad breath, impair food, cause pain and bacteria in the mouth can come off and cause damage to other organs.</string>
    <string name="tips_9">9. Bathing and brushing - In dogs, the ideal is to bathe every 15 days. In cats, this interval should be longer. The baths must be with veterinary products and with as little stress as possible. During these moments, you get a better look at your pet and thus you may notice something different or wrong.</string>
    <string name="tips_10">"10. Visits to the veterinarian - It is of great importance to make an appointment with the veterinarian at least once a year. Many diseases can be prevented with prevention. Always be aware of any change in your pet's behavior or habit, as this can signal illness."</string>
